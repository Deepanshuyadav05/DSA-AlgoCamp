Ques1.> why we use return? can we not use console.log?
Ans.>Because if we do return then we can store that value somewhere and use it in future,
     but if we do console.log then it will only get printed on the screen we can't do anything with that value


console.log returns the "undefined"
for eg:
let x = console.log("deep")
console.log(x)
//deep
  undefined

if we assign a log statement to a variable and then print it 
then in the output we will get the log statement input and undefined thats why if we console log something on the browser then we seee a undefined also

Ques2.> What if we don't return anything?
Ans.> if we manually don't return anything then JS automatically returns Undefined
